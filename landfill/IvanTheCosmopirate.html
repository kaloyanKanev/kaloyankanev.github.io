<p class="writing">Wind. Heavy wind. Shards of ice hitting his face, scraping it audibly. Wind. Can't see anything. Can't differentiate the white sky from the white ground. Wind. Snow. Pieces of ice biting at his skin. How did he get here? Doesn't matter. How will he get out of here? It won't matter for much longer. It's getting late. Where there weren't snowflakes, there was air. And the air was getting darker. Heavier. Harder to breathe.</p>
<p class="writing">He stops. He looks around, without moving his feet to not lose track of his path. His tracks behind him are instantly covered by new snow. Where is it all coming from? Won't matter. Should he be stopping in such cold? Too many questions. We can't be wasting heat on the brain. Keep moving. He keeps walking forward.</p> 
<p class="writing">He stops again.</p>

<p class="writing">Ivan's ship was quite well built. He made sure of it. Damn near starved himself to afford some parts of it. But hunger is nothing in the face of passion. What it is, however, is draining. Thus, Ivan sleeps to save on energy and food, until he gets to the next outpost. It shouldn't be too far from his current position, actually.</p>
<p class="writing">Ivan doesn't dream. He only sleeps. He used to dream. Moving through the fabric of space so fast doesn't allow for dreams to catch up. Ivan enjoys the long trips. The long hauls of cargo through colorful emptiness. He is full of joy when the bright light hits his face when he jumps out into a system. Hearing humans on the frequencies brings warmth to his loneliness. Wherever you go, there is space, and wherever there is space, there are humans, living, breathing, talking, laughing. It's a warm feeling of home everywhere you go.</p>

<p class="writing">And as Ivan looked in the mirror, he saw his mother's dark coloured eyes. He saw her crow black hair. He saw her eastern skin. He saw his father's almond eye shape. He saw his sadness, his empty stare. All this time, Ivan was trying to escape his genitors, he could never escape himself. </p>
<p class="writing">Ivan wasn't a pirate anymore. It was time to ground the ship at shore.</p>
